		<h2 class="heads">Linguistic Alchemy</h2>
		
		<div class="fp">
			<img class="fpi" src="../images/alchemy.jpg">
			<div>
				<p>Awareness of our programming, grants us the opportunity to not only change the script, but the language itself. By redefiniing languages used to enslave us we take ownership of them. Language is alive and as we change, it must as well.</p>

				<p>In our current state, Linguistic Alchemy is performed rather unofficially, through the development of slang, which is often rejected until appropriated by the colonial system. While Reprogramming Our Identities, we will do this with the goal of repurposing colonial tongues for freedom, life, and self-realization.</p>

		<h2 class="heads">Freedom</h2>
		<div>
			<div>

				<p>R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span>defines freedom as the ability to define and fulfill ones value. Additionally, freedom is unanimous and ubiquitous; therefore, if one living being is in bondage, no one is free.  This definition of freedom makes humanity accountable not only to each other, but to every living being and how we treat or, moreover, mistreat them. It makes humanity accountable to all life. </p>

				<p>Freedom to define and fulfill ones value is necessary to the perpetuation of life. This is possible by first gaining freedom from colonizers and colonial systems: spiritual, psychological, and physical. Freedom from colonial systems would allow humans to dedicate their lives to becoming the best version of oneself. This is a daunting proposition, because it requires thought, observation, and work. We'd have to figure things out rather than be told who and what we are, and what to do.  </p>

				<p>There are, however, some guidelines offered by R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span>: curate a love of self, be an asset to life when and however possible, discover your passion and share it with others, stand for life when it is difficult - nothing costs life, not even life. The living are our purpose, therefore, cannot be sacrificed. </p>

		<div class="fp pefp">
			<img class="fpi" src="../images/lands.jpg">
			<div>
				<p>Colonization has been used as an instrument of death, therefore, decolonization is an inevitable product of R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> Eurasian colonizers must vacate indigenous lands, currently none as: Africa, Australia, North America, South America, The Caribbean, and Hawaii; as they have committed crimes against them that garner a rescinding of their invitation. Even after renouncing their isms and reclaiming their humanity, colonial spaces must be de-established. </p>
