			<p>R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> (Renouncing Our Isms) recognizes that human beings are organic computers, that function perfectly when they learn how to take care of themselves; and that colonization and subsequently, industrialization, are tools used to divert humanity's progression toward Life. (Note: there is a difference between Life and survival).</p>
			<p>Like mechanical computers, humans too, can be programmed. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> proposes that the modern human has been programmed by colonization, to operate against it's own best interest - as an autoimmune disease, of sorts, to all life i.e. destroyers; and works in an effort to reprogram humanity as facilitators of life, i.e creators, by depicting the foundational flaws of our current programming and offering practical alternatives.</p> 
			<p>However, R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> is not a testament to colonization and will not reiterate the history we were all indoctrinated into by the so-called education system. We all know the tale of this system, that even in its white-washed state, is barbaric, brutal, and morally bankrupt. R.<span class="oic">o.i</span>. posits that awareness of the programming is the first step of de/reprogramming; for that reason the tenants of colonization must be discussed.</p><p> Revolution is neccessary, however, if we do not first evolve our thinking, we will revolt using only the tools provided by our oprressor.   </p>

				<p>Isms are  divisive thought processes used by oppressors to marginalize and exploit the masses. Conversely, the exploited typically use Isms to gain access to systems built on and sustained by their oppression and exploitation; leveraging existing Isms against one another and creating new ones scale the latter of respectability. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> posits that people have been programmed to identify with Isms as a firewall against revolution. In other words, when the exploited/excluded are working to be included within an oppressive regime, they are not working to dismantle it. </p>

				<p>Isms are also red herrings that teach oppressed and exploited peoples to seek inclusion through policy change - simply making the current oppressive regime more comfortable for people like them. They keep the masses focused on different branches of the oppression tree: ableism, sexism, capitalizism etc. and not the roots of the tree: erasure, colonization, and inaccountability. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> teaches that freedom is possible through the evolution of thoughts, ideas, and value systems that perpetuate oppression.</p>

				<p>Oppressed and exploited peoples often perform for the benefit of the colonial system, not the living. For example, in the united states, poor people often vote against their own best interest in favor of huge tax cuts for the wealthy. On the surface, this may seem foolish, however, classism has taught them that the wealthy are more important, putting their values at odds with their own wellness. It has also taught them that, through "hard-work" anyone can be wealthy; therfore, the poor, believing one day they will be on the receiving end of these benefits/be included, vote their Isms and not their humanity. </p>
