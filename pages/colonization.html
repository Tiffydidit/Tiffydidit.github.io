		<h2 class="heads">Linguistic Indoctrination</h2>
		<div>
			<div>
			<p>The first step in colonial, human programming is linguistic indoctrination.  After a person or group has been indoctrinated into the language of an oppressor, this language, that is not their own and in many ways can be considered malware, is used by the oppressor to define everything, including the identities of those being oppressed. These colonizer curated identities, characteristics, desires are scripts, that grant the colonizer control of the masses. 

			Consider that many colonized, indigenous people everywhere speak of even freedom in the language of their oppressor: Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish.  Now, imagine if every computer in the world each recognized a different language; passing information between machines would be rife with tedium, nearly impossible, and certainly not as addictive/fun. Like computer programming languages, linguistic indoctrination makes all types of human programming possible.

		<h2 class="heads">Psychological Eugenics</h2>
			<div class="fp pefp">

				<div>
					<p>
					Psychological eugenics, maybe the most important tenant of colonization, as it's a dynamic means of propagating self-loathing; which in turn, leads to self-destruction or the desire to be included in a system sustained by ones destruction. </p>

					<p>Psychological eugenics teaches all people being oppressed by colonization to internalize its tenants and erase themselves. In this way, the system does not need to actively oppress anyone, but simply embed the programming and allow it to run -- just as a web developer needs only to write a program and allow a mechanical computer to run the script. </p>

					<p>Psychological eugenics is a code embedded in the populous through a homogenized "education" system and various forms of media (literature, music, theatre, film, television) that programs peoples standards and values to that of their oppressor. This code runs perpetually in an infinite loop, until the system dies; if not met by an exit condition like R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span>. Asforementoned, Linguistic indoctrination makes all types of human programming possible --it's the organic equivalent of Javascript; Psychological eugenics is the organic equivalent of a JS function, that makes it almost effortless, once programmed.</p>

					<p>At it's most basic level, Psychological eugenics programs entire human populations to make unnecessary, and often, harmful physical modifications to their bodies and surroundings e.g. and lawns. Higher order Psychological eugenics programs populations to eat poison, trust the system feeding them poison to help them cultivate life, and even breed their own genetic identities out of existence; turning procreation into anti-creation.</p>

		<h1 class="sub">Base Identity</h1>

		<h2 class="heads">Blackness</h2>
		<div class="fp">
			<img class="colib"   src="../images/black.gif" >
			<div>
				<p>Black is a term/identity created by Eurasian colonizers to erase the tribal identities of indigenous peoples; making it easier to reprogram their standards, practices, and values to that of the colonizer. </p>
				<p>This identity has been programmed to recognize the value of anything beyond monetary gain. As money is a construct used to to trade life, space, and time for what is essentially not real; these are beings with no loyalty to reality. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
			</div>
			
		</div>
		<h2 class="heads">Whiteness</h2>
		<div class="fp">
			<img class="coli" src="../images/white.gif">
			<div>
				<p>Subsequently, white is a term/identity created to control the Eurasian populace effected by Isms unrelated to race: classism, sexism, heterosexism, etc. Whiteness indoctrinates exploited, Eurasians into the belief that other exploited people are their adversary and not the very system that thrives on their poverty and miseducation. </p>
				<p>This identity also does not recognize the value of life, beyond monetary gain. Thus, these are also beings with no loyalty to reality.</p>

		<h1 class="sub">Illusions</h1>
		<h2 class="heads">Choices</h2>
		<div>
			<div>
				<p>People are not colors. We all are, however, products of continental relationships i.e. relationships with lands to which we are indigenous. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> proposes that humans belong to the land and thae colonial value system that reversed that relationship, helped colonization consume the identities of idigenous people.</p>

				<p> All people that identify as black, white, and all "identity-colors" created by the colonial system are at their foundation, the same. They have been programmed to assimilate to a system of destruction and aid it by any means neccessary. Isms create levels of participation and benefit, that create the illusion of choice, however, the basic survival-cycle within colonization is: </p>
					<ul id="cycle">
						<li>Be indoctrinated.</li> 
						<li>Benefit colonization.</li> 
						<li>Consume.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>If you have children, indoctrinate them.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Die.</li>
					</ul> 

				<p> The order of events between indoctrination and death may vary; however, whether one is a banker or a barber, a convict or a scientist this is survival - homogenous, unsustainable, and destructive. </p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2 class="heads">Freedoms</h2>
		<div>
			<div>
				
				<p>The illusion of freedom is in direct relation to the illusion of choices. In the united states the populace is tricked into believing they are experiencing freedom simply by pluaralizing the word. Freedoms, unlike freedom, are relative, comparative, and truly based on cultural standards. Though freedoms vary from region to region the survival-cycle remains the same. Whether one is allowed to drive or protest, freedoms are actually Isms at work - creating varying levels of comfort within the same colonial system.</p>

				<p>In reality, one is only free to do what the de facto goverment set up by invaders will allow (survival-cycle). Additionally, if all one wanted to do were within the limits of the survival cycle, one would still have to be able to afford it. In a system sustained by oppression, there will always be poverty, because the impoverished are the cogs that run the machine. Based on the tenants of colonization, there is nothing wrong with how this system works, as this is how it was designed to operate.</p>

				<p>This system teaches us that we are the problem, because we are. Our potential to evolve beyond dependence on a system that does not serve us, is the problem. Our ability to reclaim our humanity at any time, is the problem. 
				if we choose to stop allowing ourselves to be governed by oppressors, they would have no recourse. Through utter laziness, they have put us in charge of own mistreatment: we poison the land, we imprison each other, we kill each other as we were programmed to and all we have to do is stop.  Isms, colonizer curated identites, psychological eugenics - all the dynamic ways we have been programmed to work against ourselves are, in fact, the very reason this is possible - as once we are aware of our programming we can stop running the script. It truly is that simple, but "simple ain't easy."</p>

				<p>Generations of us have survived and died, assimilated into colonial roles. What becomes of us without our scripts? What becomes of the world? R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> </p>
